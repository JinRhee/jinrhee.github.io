A GUI is often needed when using VMs and ssh'ing into shell is insufficient. Windows Remote Desktop offers a ssh-based remote access method, but has a really slow GUI. I've found NoMachine to have a much faster response (which saves a lot of headaches).

You need NoMachine on both the client and host machines:
[Install NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/getting-started-with-nomachine)

Connecting to a machine over an internet connection has a few more steps, but simply accessing a VM on your host computer is really easy!
